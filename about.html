            <h2>Come join us at the Futures Science Museum where we’re committed to making science accessible to all.</h2>
            <p>
                Over the course of human history, science has developed from our early understanding of fire, <br>
                wind, water, and earth to exploring everything from galaxies far away to the very building blocks of life itself.<br><br>
            
                The aim of our museum is to create a space where everyone can experience the wonders <br>
                of our discoveries and perhaps even ignite a lifelong passion to continue the exploration of the world around us.<br><br>
            
                We believe science should not be confined to the textbook, 
                but brought to live through exhibits.<br>
                This is why we have over 1000 different exhibits 
                on the many varied subjects of science to explore.<br> 
                Many of these exhibits are designed for you to interact with and play around to see science come to life <br>
                (apart from the dinosaur exhibits – they only come to life at night when everyone’s gone home).
