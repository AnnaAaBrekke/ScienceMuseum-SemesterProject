                    <h1>Biology and Medicine</h1>
                    <h2>From micro-organisms to the human body, major breakthroughs in biology
                        are offering us unique insights into the great wonders of the tiny world.</h2>
                    <p>For many people their life expectancy is much longer and their quality of life much improved, 
                        thanks to the growth of our understanding of medicine. Over a series of exhibits we explore the history 
                        of medicine and take a look at some major breakthroughs including the discovery of penicillin and the first heart transplant. <br> <br> 
                        Many of our great medicinal discoveries have come not only from the lab, but also from observing animals in the wild. Often our fellow creatures have beat us to it.</p>
